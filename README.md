## Requirements

Before running the demo, ensure you have the following installed:

### Visual Studio Requirements
- **Visual Studio 2022** (or later) with the following workloads:
  - **WinUI desktop development** - Desktop development with WinUI 3 and C#, optionally for C++
  - **Desktop development with C++** - With C++ (v143) tools for native components
  
### Windows SDK
- **Windows 11 SDK (10.0.22621.0)** or later

### Windows Developer Mode
You must enable Developer Mode on Windows:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Go to **System** → **For developers**
3. Enable **Developer Mode**
   - This allows you to install apps from any source, including loose files

## Git and Git LFS

> **Note on Large Library Files**
> The dynamic link library (`*.lib`) files in this repository are very large (several hundred MB each). This is because WinUI Release builds expand all inline functions during compilation, which significantly increases the instruction size and results in much larger static library files.

In this case, **Git LFS** is required to handle these large binary files efficiently.

All developers **must** have Git LFS correctly installed and configured, both on **Windows** and **macOS**, otherwise the project will not build correctly.

### macOS (with Homebrew)

```bash
brew install git-lfs
git lfs install

git clone git@github.com:RadaeePDF-Jugaad/RadaeePDF-Master-Windows-WinUI.git
cd RadaeePDF-Master-Windows-WinUI

# From now on, a normal pull will also download/update LFS files (.lib)
git pull
```

### Windows

On Windows, install Git LFS using one of the following options:

- **Git for Windows installer** (select “Git LFS” during setup), or  
- **Chocolatey**:

  ```powershell
  choco install git-lfs
  git lfs install
  ```

Then clone the repository:

```powershell
git clone git@github.com:RadaeePDF-Jugaad/RadaeePDF-Master-Windows-WinUI.git
cd RadaeePDF-Master-Windows-WinUI

# From now on, a normal pull will also download/update LFS files (.lib)
git pull
```

If you already cloned this repository in the past **without** Git LFS enabled and you are missing `.lib` files, reclone the repository after configuring Git LFS, or contact the maintainer for migration instructions.

## Quick Start - Run Demo

To quickly test the RadaeePDF SDK demo:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open Visual Studio
   - Click on **Clone a repository** (or File → Clone Repository)
   - Paste the repository URL:
     ```
     https://github.com/RadaeePDF-Jugaad/RadaeePDF-Master-Windows-WinUI.git
     ```
   - Click **Clone** and wait for the project to download

2. **Keep the Repository Up to Date**
   - From a terminal, inside the cloned folder:
     ```bash
     # Standard git
     git pull
     
     # Using git-lts (if installed in your environment)
     git-lts pull
     ```

3. **Open the Solution**
   - Visual Studio should automatically open the `RadaeeWinUI.sln` solution file
   - If not, navigate to the cloned folder and double-click `RadaeeWinUI.sln`

4. **Configure Build Settings**
   - In the toolbar, set the platform to **x86** (or other platform based on your system)
   - Set the configuration to **Debug** or **Release**

5. **Build library project**
   - In solution explorer, right click on project "RDUICom" and select **Build**
   - Wait for the build to complete

6. **Build and Run the Demo**
   - Press **F5** or click the **Start** button (▶) to build and run the demo
   - The WinUI 3 application will launch on your local machine

### Manual Installation

1. Download the RadaeePDF SDK library from Git Repository

## Getting Started

### Initialize the Library

Before using RadaeePDF, initialize the library with your license key:

1. Modify the 'RDGlobal.cs' file under namespace 'RadaeeWinUI.RadaeeUtil', to add your license key:
```csharp
static public bool init()
{
    load_data();
    int ret = RDUILib.RDGlobal.Active("[YOUR-LICENSE-KEY]");
    return ret == 3;
}
```

2. Add the following code to your 'App' class to initialize and activate the library:
```csharp
using RadaeeWinUI.RadaeeUtil;

sealed partial class App : Application
{
    protected override void OnLaunched(LaunchActivatedEventArgs e)
    {
        //...... your code
        RDGlobal.init();
        //...... your code
    }
}
```

### Open and Display a PDF

```csharp
using RadaeeWinUI.Helpers;

public sealed partial class MainViewModel : ObservableObject
{
    private readonly IDocumentManager _documentManager;
    private readonly INavigationService _navigationService;
    private readonly PDFViewModel _pdfViewModel;

    private PDFDoc? _currentDocument;
    private DocumentInfo? _documentInfo;
    private bool _isDocumentLoaded;

    public MainViewModel(
    IDocumentManager documentManager,
    INavigationService navigationService,
    PDFViewModel pdfViewModel)
    {
        _documentManager = documentManager;
        _navigationService = navigationService;
        _pdfViewModel = pdfViewModel;

        _pdfViewModel.CurrentPageChanged += _pdfPageChanged;

        //...... your code
    }

    private async Task LoadDocumentAsync(StorageFile file, string password = "")
    {
        _pdfViewModel.OnDocumentClosed();
        _documentManager.CloseDocument(_currentDocument);

        _currentDocument = await _documentManager.OpenDocumentAsync(file, password);

        if (_currentDocument != null)
        {
            DocumentInfo = _documentManager.GetDocumentInfo(_currentDocument);
            _navigationService.SetTotalPages(DocumentInfo?.PageCount ?? 0);
            _navigationService.GoToPage(0);
            IsDocumentLoaded = true;

            _pdfViewModel.OnDocumentLoaded(_currentDocument);

            //...... your code

        }
    }
}
```

## Common Operations

### Get Page Count

```csharp
int pageCount = m_doc.PageCount;
```

### Navigate to a Specific Page

```csharp
MainViewModel.GoToPage(5); // Go to page 5
```

### Set View Mode

```csharp
MainViewModel.ViewModel.PDFViewModel.SwitchViewMode(ViewMode.VerticalContinuous); // Vertical scroll mode
```

### Text Highlighting (Professional License)

```csharp
uint color = 0xFFFFFF00; // Yellow color
// Highlight selected text
PDFSel.SetSelMarkup(AnnotationType.Highlight); // highlight

// Underline selected text
PDFSel.SetSelMarkup(AnnotationType.Underline); // underline

// Strikeout selected text
PDFSel.SetSelMarkup(AnnotationType.Strikeout); // strikeout

// Rod squiggly selected text
PDFSel.SetSelMarkup(AnnotationType.Squiggly); // rod squiggly
```

### Add Annotations (Professional License)

```csharp
// Add a note annotation at point (x, y)
PDFPage page = m_doc.GetPage(0); // Get the first page
if(page != null) {
    page.ObjsStart();
    page.AddAnnotTextNote(x, y);
    page.Close();
}


// Remove annotation
PDFPage page = m_doc.GetPage(0); // Get the first page
if (page != null) {
    //Start object mode
    page.ObjsStart();
    PDFAnnot annot = page.GetAnnot(0);
    if (annot != null) { 
        annot.RemoveFromPage();
    }

    //Close page and release holding resource
    page.Close();
}
```

### Save Document

```csharp
// Save changes to the same file
m_doc.Save();

// Save to a new file
